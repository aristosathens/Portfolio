# Portfolio
This repo stores files, pictures, and links related to projects Aristos has worked on, including work, school, and hobby projects.

Please look in the repo for a copy of Aristos' resume.

### Bio
Aristos was born in Texas, but has spent most of his life in California. As you may have guessed, one of his parents is Greek from Cyprus. He is fluent in English and Greek, and dabbles in Spanish. Outside of school and his projects, Aristos enjoys reading and watching the English Premier League.

Aristos is currently a graduate student at Stanford University. His degree is in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Robotics. He received his BS from Stanford, also in Mechanical Engineering. He was initially planning on pursuing a PhD, but towards the end of undergrad he caught the CS bug. He then switched his degree focus to mechatronics/robotics, and began working on side projects to make up for lost time.

In April 2019 Aristos will begin full-time work at [Verkada](https://www.verkada.com/) as a Software Engineer.

# Projects

## Work
These are the work projects that Aristos is *allowed to share publicly*. He has done other work which cannot be shared here.

##### 3D Printer
TEAM is a bio/electro-mechanical prototyping lab which contracts to private companies and UC Davis.
-	Designed, prototyped, and manufactured a 3D printer using 3D printing, lasercutting, milling techniques.
-	Components include build platform, extruder, filament holder, motor mounts, frame, heating element.
-	Assembled functional 3D printer using my components and salvaged electrical controller.

##### Robotic Arm
The Camarillo Lab works on robotics and sensor technology for medical applications.
-	Developed mathematical models for position estimation of end effector in Auris soft robotic arms.
-	Wrote Python controller for setting and following end effector trajectories.
-	Improved range and responsiveness of end effector using concentric robotic arms.

##### Heat Exchanger
Ford Motors funded project on demonstrating the "Ionocaloric" effect, or entropy-driven bulk cooling.
-	Designed and fabricated counter-flow heat exchangers.
-	Wrote scripts to automate logging and analysis of temperature and flow data.
-	High efficiency exchanger contributed to improved characterization of Ionocaloric redox agents.

##### Cartilage
I participated in Stanfordâ€™s Bio-X Undergraduate Summer Research Program, which provided funding for the summer. I did work related to cartilage biomechanics in Dr. Marc Levenston's lab.

I worked on a project with Dr. Jerry Hu and Dr. Eleftherios Makris to test the integration properties of tissue-engineered cartilage into native tissue. I wrote a scientific paper as the first author (publication below). We have also prepared a patent application, submitted by UC Davis.

Peer-reviewed journal article:

## School
While at Stanford Aristos has worked on dozens of projects, but these are his favorites.

##### Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (CS 231N):
- For our final project we developed and trained an architecture for semantic image segmantation. We used a Baidu dataset consisting of images taken from the dash of a moving vehicle.

##### Smart Product Design Applications (ME 218B):
- For our final project we designed and constructed a fully autonomous robot to compete against other robots in a game similar to hockey/basketball.
