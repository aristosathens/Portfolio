## Bio
Aristos was born in Texas, but has spent most of his life in California. As you may have guessed, one of his parents is Greek from Cyprus. He is fluent in English and Greek, and dabbles in Spanish. Outside of school and his projects, Aristos enjoys reading and watching the English Premier League.

Aristos is currently a graduate student at Stanford University. His degree is in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Robotics. He received his BS from Stanford, also in Mechanical Engineering. He was initially planning on pursuing a PhD, but towards the end of undergrad he caught the CS bug. He then switched his degree focus to mechatronics/robotics, and began working on side projects to make up for lost time.

In April 2019 Aristos will begin full-time work at [Verkada](https://www.verkada.com/) as a Software Engineer.
